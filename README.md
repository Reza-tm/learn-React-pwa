## How run project ❓

In **terminal** / **cmd** run ==> `npm start`
It will open on localhost:9999 by default 🚀

This is an applcation for post something to firebase server with PWA fetures 👀
But what is fetures ?

- With caching system you can use this application without internet ❗️

- With background sync you can post even you haven't accses to network 🤯
